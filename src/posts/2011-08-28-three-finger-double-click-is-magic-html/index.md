    The three finger double click gesture in Lion is pure magic. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Technovangelist/status/107474901190983682">It took a while for it to sink in</a>, but when <a href="http://www.macsparky.com/blog/2011/8/26/lion-dictionary-with-three-finger-double-tap.html">MacSparky</a> mentioned it, the neurons in my brain finally processed it. And today it came in really handy. One of my pet peeves is seeing a word show up in a sentence multiple times when a synonym would be much more interesting. I especially hate it when it&#8217;s my writing. But sometimes I just have to stare blankly at the wall for a few minutes to think of a good word to use. Either that or get my lazy ass off the chair and walk over to the thesaurus on my bookshelf. Like the three finger double click, the existence of a thesaurus in the Mac had never quite sunk in either.<img style="margin: 5px 0px 5px 20px" title="Process Thesaurus.png" src="/static/500c9c42c4aa27cb90863e5e/50e9971de4b01058545b4678/50e99720e4b01058545b499a/1314537851467/Process%20Thesaurus.png/1000w" border="0" alt="Looking up Process..." width="200" height="217" align="right" />

    So today I was writing up a script for a video I am about to record on sending a fax with Outlook Web Access. I bet I know what you&#8217;re thinking. You are thinking that that video will be FREAKING AWESOME. You are right my brother, you are right. Well, I wrote a sentence that had me staring at the wall for a few minutes and just as I started to glance over to the Roget&#8217;s on the shelf, I remembered the secret gesture.

    Up popped the mini dialog you see in the picture to the right. In the words of Meg Ryan in Sleepless in Seattle….MMMMMAGIC!!! Unfortunately, the results it gave me weren&#8217;t that helpful, but clicking on the Thesaurus in the dialog opened the full Dictionary app and I found the word I needed. MAGIC SQUARED!
