title: Robert Satterwhite
---

  <p>
    I was just catching up on reading some feeds and noticed both&nbsp;<a href="http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/blogs/owen/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=20">Owen Allen</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://devhawk.net/2008/08/19/Missing+Missing+Persons.aspx" class="broken_link">Harry Pierson</a>&nbsp;talking about the death of Robert Satterwhite. I am completely shocked about this. I think I had last seen Robert a couple of years ago, but I talked to him on the phone several times since, after I had moved to Amsterdam and left Microsoft. Harry mentioned&nbsp;that he had worked with Robert on the NAT team. I was the Technology Specialist at the time for State and Local Government at Microsoft, and I would often work with both of them down in Olympia, or at various other city government offices around the state. While I have known other people who have died, this is the first person I would classify as a friend who has died (outside of family). Will take a bit to process&#8230;.
