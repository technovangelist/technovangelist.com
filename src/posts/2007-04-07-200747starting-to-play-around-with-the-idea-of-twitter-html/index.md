Still not sure if I love it yet. If you are using <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>, I am <a href="http://twitter.com/Technovangelist">Technovangelist</a> (gosh, bet you didn&#8217;t guess that one&#8230;). Basically Twitter is like a far less detailed (140 or so characters) but far more frequently updatable blog. I think&#8230;

I actually tried playing with it a couple weeks ago, but ran into problems. I was in Dubai and UAE blocks certain sites which are believed to be inappropriate. Twitter is one of those sites. Flickr is also blocked. Unless of course you are VPN&#8217;d into a US company, but setting up a VPN to post a short message is a bit crazy.
