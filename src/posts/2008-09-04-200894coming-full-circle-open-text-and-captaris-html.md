    Wow, it looks like I have come back to where I started. My first real job (second if you count the camera shop on Key Biscayne I worked in during High School, third if you count my Islander News paper route) was in Tech Support for PC Docs in Tallahassee, Florida. Soon after I left the company to move to New York City, they got bought out by Hummingbird. Then Hummingbird got bought &nbsp;by Open Text. Since then I have spent time working for small companies and big ones (Microsoft) and now Captaris. Then today Open Text announced that they are acquiring Captaris. So I am back where I began&#8230;bizarre!
