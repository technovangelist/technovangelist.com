title: AutoStitch on iPhone
---
I have had [AutoStitch on the iPhone][1]{.broken_link} for quite a while. It&#8217;s an oldie, but definitely a goodie. Panorama apps are all over the place, but this one continues to be the best I have seen.

The process is simple. Open the app, and start taking pictures. As you rotate the camera, you see a blue outline around what you previously took and a green box around the full frame when you have enough overlap of the next frame. It says you only need about 20% overlap, but I tend to go with 50-75% overlap.

When you have taken the last image, the app will stitch them all together. You can choose to crop the photo automatically, or leave the black portions in place. Sometimes it feels appropriate to keep the borders straight, other times the curvature and uneven edges feels right.
