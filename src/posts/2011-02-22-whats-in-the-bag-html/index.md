    Every now and then I see one of those posts that shows what someone is carrying in their bag. I love those posts. I love seeing what people carry every day. I love comparing what they carry to what I carry every day. This is not one of those posts. This is the worst-case scenario, I don&#8217;t carry this every day. This is what I was carrying in my carry-on on a plane from San Antonio, Texas to where I live in Amsterdam. While the bulk of it was on a 777 from Chicago, the first few hours were on a Canadair jet which means I couldn&#8217;t carry any big bags for carry on, and yet this was all with me.
