For the last few weeks Adam Curry has been praising the anonymous owners of the wireless networks in his SF condo. Well, I had been silently doing the same myself over the weekend, but for the last two days the love has all but dried up. What gives?!?! Free wifi is gone. You mean I actually have to pay for this stuff??? Ugh. Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t mind paying but the local phone company has given me an estimate of 20 working days to turn on DSL&hellip;at least thats what I think the letter said&hellip;its all in Dutch.&nbsp;Its a freaking switch in the local switch. Dude!!! Do you want me to do it for you? How hard can it be? 20 days hard??? ugh&hellip;.I really have to train myself to get used to the crap customer service here&hellip;
