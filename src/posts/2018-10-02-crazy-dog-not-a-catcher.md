This morning I posted a video on IGTV. It's about Jade and her amazing skills as a dog. Catch is a common game dogs like, right? ummmm, well, not so much. Well, she enjoys it, she just doesn't play the way you expect.

I would love it if I could embed an IGTV video, but I can't. The more I play with it, the less useful IGTV seems to be. Here is the URL for the IGTV page:  https://www.instagram.com/technovangelist/channel/

PS. we are still working on potty training. She is mostly really good, but we are hoping this will help solve some of the gaps: Rocco & Roxie Stain & Odor Eliminator - https://amzn.to/2Q77TTf
