    The sun is shining here in San Antonio, Texas. And its a brand new year. Looking back on the year that was, I see that there were some good times and some bad. Mostly good though. I did a lot of travel, though its never as much as I would like. I had a chance to visit new countries, like Argentina, Uruguay, and South Africa. I had a chance to visit some of my favorite spots too, like Sydney and Singapore. I had a chance to spend time with my best friends from high school at my 20 year high school reunion (Coral Gables Senior High, 1988). I met new friends by getting out and doing more with MeetIn Amsterdam. And of course the biggest achievement was moving into the first apartment I had ever purchased, and completing its renovation. On the down side, a couple of friends from my days at Microsoft died, Gary Falis and Robert Satterwhite. Then many colleagues were let go after the acquisition of Captaris by OpenText was completed. I had been told by others who had gone through the same process at other companies that the way OpenText did it was amazingly good, but it was still a tough process, even though I was among the still-employed at the end.

    Looking forward on the year to come I am pretty excited about the opportunities open to me. I have come up with my list of resolutions, many of which I will not be sharing here. I am open and all, but some things I want to keep closed. But I here are some of my thoughts:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      I am now part of a new company with new ways of doing things. I want to discover how I can best help this one by leveraging my own unique skills.
    </li>

      Photography has always been my primary hobby, but I don&#8217;t practice it enough anymore. I gave many of my photographs as presents to my family for Christmas this year and they were a big hit, but most of them were from years ago. I have a new goal of taking at least one photograph every day, then publishing one on my Flickr account at least every few days.
    </li>

      I moved into my new home back in January, but most of my stuff is still in boxes. Seriously, my biggest items of furniture are stacks of boxes: my nightstands, my closet, etc&#8230;they are just boxes. I will be addressing that issue this year, building some storage, shelves, and more myself.
    </li>

      I really enjoy my job. One of the best parts about it is the travel. I just can&#8217;t get enough of it. I am hoping this will be a year of new places just like every year before. I am hoping to be able to visit India, China, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Greece, and maybe even a return visit to Nepal.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    I have more goals, but I am going to keep those close to me and not share them. I am trying to figure out what is the right way to keep them accessible so I review them regularly. Right now they are in Evernote, but I am sure I can come up with a better solution.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Now I know that some people will say that those goals suck. They aren&#8217;t even real. They aren&#8217;t SMART, or SAFE, or they don&#8217;t abide by some other ridiculous set of rules. These goals are for me&#8230;just me. They are not so that you can judge me at the end of the year&#8230;they are just for me.

    2009 could be a very good year for me and it all starts right now!
