As a reader of this blog, you know there are three things that I care about and write about: Travel, Gadgets, and Captaris. But most of you are interested in only one of those topics. Well, at the recent Captaris International Partner Conference I was invited to start blogging on the Captaris Developer Portal and saw this as a chance to move one of the audiences to a place that is more relevant to them. So starting now all posts about Captaris Workflow, Rightfax, and Alchemy will be posted on my new blog at the Captaris Developer Portal. On the site I am TrainerMatt and my blog is: <a title="http://www.captaris.com/DeveloperProgram/blogs/trainermatt_blog/default.aspx" href="http://www.captaris.com/DeveloperProgram/blogs/trainermatt_blog/default.aspx">http://www.captaris.com/DeveloperProgram/blogs/trainermatt_blog/default.aspx</a>
