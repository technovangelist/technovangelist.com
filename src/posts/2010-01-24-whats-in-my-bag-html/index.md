  <p>
    I have had a <a href="http://www.thinktankphoto.com/products/urban-disguise-60-shoulder-computer-bag.aspx" class="broken_link">ThinkTank Urban Disguise 60</a> bag for a few months now and it is my daily work bag. It is an amazing product able to fit all sorts of things even completely zipped up. I just filled it up for a trip to Barcelona and even though I have used it before, I am still amazed at how much I put in there. Here is a list of everything (that I can remember) that is inside. Again, this is completely zipped, not bulging:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      15&#8243; Macbook Pro with power supply
    </li>
    <li>
      2 external harddrives
    </li>
    <li>

    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://nikonusa.com/Find-Your-Nikon/Product/Digital-SLR/25444/D700.html" class="broken_link">Nikon D700</a> w/ <a href="http://nikonusa.com/Find-Your-Nikon/Product/Power-Packs/25359/MB-D10-Multi-Power-Battery-Pack.html" class="broken_link">MBD10</a> & <a href="http://nikonusa.com/Find-Your-Nikon/Product/Camera-Lenses/2180/AF-S-NIKKOR-50mm-f%252F1.4G.html" class="broken_link">50mm1.4G</a> mounted
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://nikonusa.com/Find-Your-Nikon/Product/Camera-Lenses/1986/AF-Zoom-NIKKOR-80-200mm-f%252F2.8D-ED.html" class="broken_link">Nikon 80-200/2.8</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://nikonusa.com/Find-Your-Nikon/Product/Camera-Lenses/2163/AF-S-NIKKOR-14-24mm-f%252F2.8G-ED.html" class="broken_link">Nikon 14-24/2.8</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://www.gitzo.com/cms/site/gitzo/tripods/traveler?code=GT1541T">Gitzo 1541T Tripod</a> w/&nbsp;<a href="http://reallyrightstuff.com/ballheads/02.html">Really Right Stuff BH25 LR ball head</a>&nbsp;(yes, INSIDE the bag)
    </li>
    <li>
      various cables, card readers, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      Zoom H4N
    </li>
    <li>
      Nikon SB800
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    Everything that doesn&#8217;t fit in the bag (contacts, extra batteries, other wires, Canon P&S camera, etc) just goes in the many pockets of the <a href="http://www.scottevest.com/v3_store/Fleece_Jacket.shtml">Scott eVest Fleece</a> or <a href="http://www.scottevest.com/v3_store/Evolution_Jacket.shtml">Evolution</a>&nbsp;jacket.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    And since I don&#8217;t really want to carry a briefcase when walking around with just the camera, I put the <a href="http://www.thinktankphoto.com/products/speed-racer-belt-pack.aspx" class="broken_link">ThinkTank Speed Racer</a> in my checked bag. Yes, that Domke F2 bag that I have been using since I was in high school (20 something years ago) has finally been retired.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    So the result of this is that I have everything I need in a single carry-on that <em>looks</em>&nbsp;like it meets all the requirements set by most airlines. I can&#8217;t tell you how amazed I am that this is even possible.
