    Its over!!! My month long vacation ends tomorrow when I have to wake up before 10 for the first time. 30 days ago, I created a list of things I was going to do. Time to go through that list and see what I actually did. I think it worked out even better than I planned and I&#8217;ll tell you why afterwards:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Tweak this site &#8211; come up with a blog design that I really like and that isn&#8217;t broken in some spots. Make it easier to update and friendlier to you &#8211; <strong>Well, I tweaked it a bit, but not a whole lot. I had some fun with it.</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      Read some books I have bought in the last few months (and put them into action) <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/books/cssant2/">CSS Anthology</a> &#8211; <strong>Yeah, I flipped through it a bit</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/books/design1/">Principles of Beautiful Web Design</a> &#8211; <strong>I read it, but didn&#8217;t really take it to heart</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="http://www.manning.com/payette/">Windows Powershell in Action</a> &#8211; <strong>Didn&#8217;t even touch it</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Unit-Testing-NUnit-2nd/dp/0977616673/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_b">Pragmatic Unit Testing in C#</a> &#8211; <strong>Touched it, but didn&#8217;t crack the cover</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      Organize my life &#8211; <ul>
        <li>
          Get rid of some of this extra crap in my apartment &#8211; <strong>I bought some more crap instead</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          Get rid of the extra feeds I don&#8217;t really read in Google Reader &#8211; <strong>They are all too important</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          Get rid of the extra crap on all my PCs, etc. &#8211; <strong>Nope, didn&#8217;t do that either</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      Every time I have seen something interesting on the net, I added them to <a href="http://del.icio.us/technovangelist">my del.icio.us account</a>. Now I can actually look at them. &#8211; <strong>OK, good in theory, but didn&#8217;t quite get around to it</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      Prepare for my new apartment &#8211; Be a bit more involved in the renovations as they come closer to completion. &#8211; <strong>It was certainly easier to do when work didn&#8217;t get in the way, but I wasn&#8217;t any more involved than before</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      Write up some reviews of amazing software I use everyday and that I can&#8217;t live without <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="http://trydash.com/home/" class="broken_link">Dash</a> &#8211; <strong>No, but I still love it</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="http://clearcontext.com/">ClearContext</a> &#8211; <strong>A review would have given me a free license, but I just paid up instead to upgrade</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="http://spinvox.com/">SpinVox</a> &#8211; <strong>Did that one</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="http://www.priacta.com/trog/">Trog Bar</a> &#8211; <strong>No, but its really cool&#8230;did that count?</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      Learn&nbsp;about new and interesting technologies that I haven&#8217;t had a chance to really focus on yet (I could probably spend a month alone on each of these):
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <ul>
        <li>

        <li>

        <li>
          Windows Vista Sidebar development &#8211;&nbsp;<strong>Nothing here</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          Firefox and Thunderbird addon development &#8211;&nbsp;<strong>I briefly looked into Chrome dev</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          The new stuff in Visual Studio 2008 &#8211;&nbsp;<strong>Never even launched VS</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          LINQ &#8211;&nbsp;<strong>I can now spell it correctly</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          Windows Presentation Foundation &#8211;&nbsp;<strong>No</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          Windows Communication Foundation &#8211;&nbsp;<strong>Nada</strong>&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>

          System Center &#8211;&nbsp;<strong>Still need to download it from MSDN</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      Actually start to use Powershell more often so that I don&#8217;t have to relearn it every time. &#8211;<strong>Never touched Powershell</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      Maybe see a little bit of Amsterdam and the Netherlands. There is so little I have seen of this place.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.style-files.com/2007/11/26/amsterdam-design-guide/">This guide</a>&nbsp;might help. &#8211;&nbsp;<strong>Didn&#8217;t see anything new</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      Sleep &#8211; I plan to sleep a lot. I haven&#8217;t been getting much of that for a while. &#8211;&nbsp;<strong>I did exceptionally well on this one.</strong>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    So there is my list. As you can see I did far better than I had ever expected. I managed to stay away from semi-work-related stuff for an entire month. It was magical. And I did a lot of work in managing my photos and using Lightroom and Photoshop to prepare for a wall of photos in my new place. My Lightroom catalog went from 4000 images to well over 11000 photos. Very few were new, I just had them scattered across 4 different PCs. It was especially amazing to find some photos I thought I lost from Nepal, Costa Rica, Moscow, and more.

    I wholeheartedly recommend taking a month off at the end of the year to relax. Don&#8217;t go anywhere, just sit and rest. What? You only get 2 weeks vacation? OK, sell everything, move to Europe, get a job, and then take that month off. Even better, take the full 6 or 7 weeks everyone gets over here. I will someday be able to change my ways to do that too&#8230;
