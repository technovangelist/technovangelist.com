A friend recently left a comment asking if I had visited anywhere I would not ever want to return to. The answer is No. That has been one of the things I hadn&rsquo;t expected. Every place I have been has been somewhere I could see myself living in for a significant amount of time (> 1 year). Recent cities have been Lisbon, Opatija, Zagreb, Oslo, Amsterdam (well, I live here now), Brussels, Utrecht. All of these are very livable&nbsp;cities where I would love to spend more time. I have no idea what to expect of Dubai in a couple of weeks, but&nbsp;from what I have heard it may be another city to return to.

In fact, looking back on all the cities I have&nbsp;ever been to for any amount of time, the only&nbsp;ones I would prefer not to return to for more than a vacation would be any in Florida or the&nbsp;US South. I grew up in Miami and went to college in Tallahassee (FSU) and I don&rsquo;t think I will ever return for more than a week at a time. Now that my parents are selling the house&nbsp;in Miami and moving to Seattle, my visits to&nbsp;Miami will go down even further.&nbsp;

One of the highlights of my job right now is the amount of time I spend in cities around the world. Luckily my job requires that I stay in each city for at least 4 or 5 days and usually more like a week. Although much of that time is spent in a hotel or office, there are still plenty of opportunities to experience how people live in the area. My parents recently got back from a vacation in Australia. Every time they finish a long trip they vow never to get on a long distance plane again because it drains them so much. Every time I finish a trip I can&rsquo;t wait for the next one. I cherish the time I spend in each of these countries and almost feel guilty that I don&rsquo;t take more advantage of my time there.

I plan to make better use of my time in the United Arab Emirates. In fact, I stopped off at the American Book Company near where I live to pick up a &ldquo;Teach Yourself Gulf Arabic&rdquo; CD/Book. I don&rsquo;t expect to become fluent, but as long as I can get a few key phrases, greet the class each morning, and get directions from the people on the street, I will be happy. If anyone has any recommendations for places to go while I am there, I would love to hear them.

For me, traveling is what I love to do most. Only downside is that I don&rsquo;t get much time to see very much of the country I live in. But for now, that&rsquo;s OK.
