Ahhh, I finally have connectivity. It only took about 6 weeks but KPN finally got me hooked up. When I first moved in, my realtor got me started with KPN for DSL (KPN is a local phone company for those of you in the US). A few weeks after I arrived a box came in the mail with my DSL modem, a couple of RJ11 phone cable, a RJ45 CAT5 patch cable, and this funky adapter I had never seen before. My first task was to find a phone jack in the wall.

I looked everywhere and could not find anything, which was a bit worrying. So I went back to the box and picked up that wierd adapter thing. The phone jacks in Holland are bizarre&hellip;kinda like a power plug, but not.
