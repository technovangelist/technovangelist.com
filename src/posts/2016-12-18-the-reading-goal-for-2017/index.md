title: Reading The Next 93 – A goal for 2017

<p class="p1">
  Looking back on 2016, I think there are many accomplishments to be proud of. Speaking in front of 1800 at re:Invent is a specific highlight, but there is something else that is even more magnificent in my eyes. This past year saw my awakening to reading.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  OK, I could read before. But I read for information, to learn something specific. This year I read for fun. Reading became something I enjoyed. And even better, this year was the year I discovered the power of the Public Library. Yes, I had been to libraries before, but I did not love them like I do now. Today my local library is the Connolly branch of the Boston Public Library system and in a few months I will be able to start using the library almost across the street in Jamaica Plain (it&#8217;s been under renovation since we moved in to the neighborhood). I am so excited.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  This year I think I read about 50-60 books. Before, the average for the year might be 1 or 2. But I couldn&#8217;t tell you what most of this year&#8217;s books were. Sure, &#8220;Fire in the Valley&#8221; and &#8220;Deep Work&#8221; stick out in my mind. So does the amazing story of a possible CIA agent captured in the Iranian revolution called &#8220;Off the Radar&#8221;, written by his son. Yes, those stick out, but the rest are mostly gone. Boston Public Library has a feature that will record your checkout history, but it doesn&#8217;t work. GoodReads has an integration with the BPL app, but its a manual step that I forget to click. I need to get better at this.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  So that is a goal for 2017. The goal is to write a little summary of what I read. This will force the memory to last a bit longer than it does today. And the corollary goal is to read the books that I have. Sure, the library will continue to tempt me with stories and facts but I have my own library that I have neglected for years. So I have created a list of books that I want to tackle for 2017. Some are books that are currently checked out from the library, others are books we own. Some came from me, others from my wife. Some I have read a few chapters of, others have sat unopened for decades. I intend to read them. All of them?? I don&#8217;t know. But I would like to review this list in a year and see how I did. So here is the list for the me of 12 months forth:

If you would like to follow along with my progress, I started using Libib to track this stuff: <a href="https://technovangelist.libib.com/">https://technovangelist.libib.com/</a>
