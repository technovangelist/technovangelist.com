title: I don’t know what happened…css gone wacky
---
I don&#8217;t know what I have done, but all of a sudden the CSS went wacky. I think there was something in the post about my grocery store trip that made things stop flowing correctly. Its not a browser specific issue. Hopefully I will have it figured out soon.
