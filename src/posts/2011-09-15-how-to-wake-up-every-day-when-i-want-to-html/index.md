    Alarm clocks have always been a problem for me. I have an alarm clock one day, then it gets left behind in a hotel room. Or I rely on the alarm on the Blackberry and the phone crashes that night (that happened way too often). I try to use the hotel alarm clock and I get AM and PM swapped around. It wasn&#8217;t until I had a reliable phone platform as well as an easy to use alarm app that this problem went away. <a href="http://www.roguesheep.com/easyalarms.html">EasyAlarms</a> from <a href="http://www.roguesheep.com/">Rogue Sheep</a> is that app for me. Its just so damned easy.

    I can set an alarm in a few taps, snooze, skip a day, edit. It works every time, it doesn&#8217;t have too many features, and it looks great. Why can&#8217;t all alarm apps be this good. Check out how I use EasyAlarms in this video:
