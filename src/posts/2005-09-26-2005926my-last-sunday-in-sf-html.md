Its really coming down to the last days&hellip;This is the end of my last weekend living in San Francisco and in the US&hellip;well, at least for a year or two. I figured I should probably get out of my apartment and not waste the day so I went for a walk in my neighborhood, while listening to <a href="http://www.bicyclemark.org/blog/">BicycleMark</a>&rsquo;s podcast. Also brought along the camera so go check out the photos in the <a href="/photos/technovangelist/default.aspx" class="broken_link">gallery</a>.
