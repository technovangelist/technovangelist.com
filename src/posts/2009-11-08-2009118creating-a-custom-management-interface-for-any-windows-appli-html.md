    Recently I posted an article about creating a new Custom Management Interface using the Microsoft Management Console up at <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://faxlearning.wordpress.com/2009/10/28/creating-a-custom-management-interface-for-alchemy-or-any-other-application/" target="_blank">faxlearning.wordpress.com</a>. This article specifically focuses on Open Text Document Server, Alchemy Edition, but the concepts apply to any Windows application. Check out the article and let me know what you think, either here or on the faxlearning blog site.
