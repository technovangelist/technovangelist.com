Its snowing here in Amsterdam right now&hellip;again. I have been thinking back to other places I have lived in and I can&rsquo;t think of any that had as many snow days as here.&nbsp;In San Francisco, the only snow I saw was trucked in for&nbsp;<a href="/photos/technovangelist/picture67.aspx" class="broken_link">Johnny Mosely</a>&nbsp;and a whole bunch of&nbsp;<a href="/photos/technovangelist/picture66.aspx" class="broken_link">snowboarders on Filmore</a>. In Seattle, it would snow one day per year and all hell would break lose on the roads. In New York it would pile down in a couple of days, with beautiful mountains at every corner for a few hours until they turned into dark grey chunks of taxi dust. Tallahassee certainly saw no snow and Miami? Yeah right. The only snow I saw growing up was shaved ice mounds at the University of Miami.

But here in Amsterdam it snowed a few days in December and quite a few in January. We are on our 3rd straight day of snow right now. It doesn&rsquo;t really stick much, but it is falling. I went out this morning to take some photos and will post them, as soon as I finish writing that damned performance review my manager has been asking me to do for weeks now.
