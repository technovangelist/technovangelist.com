Money comes in&hellip;and money goes out&hellip;

I have a few new toys now, all of which I just had to have:

<span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><span><img src="/static/500c9c42c4aa27cb90863e5e/50e9971de4b01058545b4678/50e99720e4b01058545b495e/1257622966477/PSP_2Dfront_Wht_small.jpg/1000w" alt="" /></span></span>Playstation Portable &ndash; Getting rid of my XBox leaves a big void in gaming. I want something portable that doesn&rsquo;t require a TV and thus doesn&rsquo;t care about PAL or NTSC. The PSP does it, and it is really gorgeous. Got two games with this: Ridge Racer and WipeOut. I remember Wipeout on the PC being really cool&hellip;this is a bit lame. RidgeRacer is to PSP as Project Gotham is the XBox: fantastic racing game that came out at the same time as the console. The two games will keep me going for a while. Next purchase will probably be Lumines.

Instead I had to settle for an iPod. The device itself is pretty great. Fantastic interface. The big downside is iTunes. I can&rsquo;t believe Apple has gotten away with producing such a shoddy piece of software. WMP isn&rsquo;t perfect, but there is no comparison here. The install is half-ass, and the app itself has a tendency to crash. ugh. Thankfully there are tools like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.redchairsoftware.com/anapod/" class="broken_link">Anapod</a>&nbsp;from Red Chair Software. Otherwise this would have been sent back to Amazon for a refund.

Getting an I-Go Juice means I have one power adapter for everything. And I can charge two at a time. But its not just good for plugging into the wall, but also into the air power sockets as well as the car lighter socket.
