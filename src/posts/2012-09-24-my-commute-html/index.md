My commute these days is minimal. I wake up, cross the hall, sit down and get to work. I have had this commute for about a year on most days. Up until July 1, I had an office to go to in Hoofddorp, but that wasn&#8217;t a place I enjoyed going to so I tended to stay away as much as possible. Obviously when I had a class, I would go in but interest in training was dropping. Working from home is something that many people would die for, but I hate it. 

I want to go somewhere. I want to see people. I want to shuffle through the crowds. Thats one of the many key factors involved in my upcoming move. My commute starting in 2 weeks is going to be great. On a good day, I&#8217;ll be able to wander up from my apartment near the Christian Science Center, through the Boston Common, to my office on Summer St in Boston. On a bad day I&#8217;ll take the T from Symphony. And I&#8217;ll be going to an office that I enjoy being in, with people I want to work around. I can&#8217;t wait. 

But until then, and for the last few months, I have inserted a bit of a commute that I have come to love. I wander the streets of Amsterdam. Recently that commute involves a walk from my place near Jan Pieter Heijestraat up to Marnixstraat, zig-zagging through the canals to get to [Lungoccino][1] for a Lungoccino. Then through the Begijnhof for those late mornings. Up along the Kalverstraat and keep going to Centraal Station. Then take whichever ferry is leaving next. Then stay on the boat for the return and take the 1 tram home. Its a wonderful way to start the day and I may actually miss it.
