I listen to a lot of podcasts. And I do it all the time. This morning I couldn&#8217;t sleep, so at 5 I started listening to some podcasts. I am sure that&#8217;s bad at all sorts of levels, but I am addicted. So I thought I would share with you my current list of absolutely required podcasts to listen to, plus the new ones I am starting to get into.

First off, if you are relying on iTunes to get your podcasts, then wake up and discover <a href="http://vemedio.com/products/instacast" class="broken_link">Instacast</a>. There is an iPhone and iPad version and they are fantastic. The only caveat with the two versions is while they claim to sync, they don&#8217;t. But I still love them.

OK, so what are the required podcasts? Here we go, roughly in order of best to…well…not best.

<strong>The ones I listen to as soon as the new episode comes out</strong>

<a href="http://youlooknicetoday.com/">You Look Nice Today</a> &#8211; I am so excited that &#8220;That&#8217;s Babies&#8221; is no longer the most recent show. This is Merlin Mann, Lonely Sandwich, and the other guy at their best! Razzledazzle!

<a href="http://www.npr.org/rss/podcast/podcast_detail.php?siteId=6661111" class="broken_link">NPR Foreign Dispatch</a> &#8211; This is my #1 source of news

<a href="http://javascriptjabber.com/">Javascript Jabber</a> &#8211; The most perfect show on Javascript. I keep re-listening to the one with Paul Irish.

<a href="http://whispercities.org/">Whisper Cities</a> &#8211; Only 3 episodes with 2-4 months between each, but great stories about urban architecture. Escalate makes me want to discover the metro in my own city.

<a href="http://99percentinvisible.org/">99% Invisible</a> &#8211; I wish they did this more often. Similar to RadioLab in style and 100% perfect.

<a href="http://www.radiolab.org/">WNYC RadioLab</a> &#8211; I don&#8217;t think I have heard an episode on here that isn&#8217;t spectacular. <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/blogs/radiolab-blog/2011/sep/20/loop-loop/">Loop the Loop</a> was definitely my favorite!

<a href="http://www.swayproductions.com/spotcast/spotcast.html">Spotcast</a> &#8211; I started at the beginning with the Lonely Sandwich episodes which were fantastic and they just get better. An interview show with filmmakers.

<a href="http://loveandradio.org/">Love & Radio</a> &#8211; Think 99% Invisible and RadioLab, then cover the kids&#8217; ears.

<a href="http://bjango.com/articles/iterate/">Iterate</a> &#8211; More web dev along with mobile dev in there as well

<a href="http://5by5.tv/mpu">Mac Power Users</a> &#8211; There are some things they say that are annoying, but generally this is one of those top notch shows. The Workflows shows are my favorites and the absolute best episodes of any podcast I listen to are the Merlin Mann Workflow shows. OMG, rocked….my…..world!!!!

<a href="http://twit.tv/show/triangulation">Triangulation</a> &#8211; Great interviews with interesting people. The Capn Crunch episodes were some of the best, but they are all good

<strong>The ones that are mostly good</strong>

<a href="http://5by5.tv/criticalpath">The Critical Path</a> &#8211; Horace Dediu usually comes up with some interesting analysis that makes me want to visit the site to learn more.

<a href="http://digitalfilm.tv/digital-convergence-podcast/">DigitalFilm.TV Digital Convergence</a> &#8211; Great filmmakers podcast. Sometimes too much of a lovefest of Canon, but when they talk more generally it gets great.

<a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/podcast">This American Life</a> &#8211; The NPR show. Its great, and I have nothing bad to say about it and it should be spectacular, but I find myself listening to the others at the top of this list first

<a href="http://www.trancearoundtheworld.com/" class="broken_link">Above & Beyond: Trance Around The World</a> &#8211; Great stuff for those long Plane/Train/Automobile rides

<strong>The ones I keep around just in case</strong>

<a href="http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze">Build & Analyze</a> &#8211; Interesting, but I really wish they would edit it down

<a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w">Back to Work</a> &#8211; Like most 5&#215;5 shows, this is just way too drawn out. But Merlin Mann is a godd and I will listen to anything with him (even though I get him mixed up with Ze Frank)

<a href="http://www.theverge.com/label/podcast">The VergeCast</a> &#8211; This should be good, but I keep finding myself skipping forward searching for a good bit

<a href="http://thebroshow.com/">The Bro Show</a> &#8211; Like 5&#215;5, many of the 70Decibels shows sound too similar. Pick one. I might drop this one soon.

<strong>The ones that I just heard about and have a lot of potential</strong>

<a href="http://www.70decibels.com/512podcast/">512 Podcast</a>

<a href="http://theindustry.cc/category/podcast/">The Industry</a>

<a href="http://mikesonmics.com/" class="broken_link">Mikes on Mics</a> &#8211; Mike Vardy&#8217;s new thing so could be good
