  <p>
    A few weeks ago, I made an impulse purchase. I had been reading about them for a while and hearing about how underpowered the Atom-based Netbooks were. Then I bought an <a href="http://www.hdtvlounge.net/news/asus-eee-box-b204-b206/" target="_blank">Asus B204</a> Nettop to hook up to my Pioneer plasma. It does an amazing job of playing videos that are stored on a <a href="http://www.drobo.com" target="_blank">Drobo</a> that I shoved in a closet. It does everything I need, is whisper quiet, and consumes a tiny amount of power. In fact, it does almost everything my <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheCodingHorrorUltimateDeveloperRigThrowdownPart1.aspx" target="_blank">Quad-Core home office machine</a> was doing (at least the stuff I left it on 24/7 to accomplish) and consumes 1/20th of the power. Its a savings of at least 140 Euros/year and its a much better all-round experience.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Then I finally decided to just do it. I headed over to <a href="http://mycom.nl/" target="_blank">Mycom</a> in Hoofddorp (near my office), and picked up an <a href="http://usa.asus.com/products.aspx?modelmenu=1&model=2792&l1=24&l2=164&l3=0&l4=0" target="_blank">Asus Eee PC 1000HE</a>. One of the main features of this model vs the other netbooks was a long battery life. In fact it was advertised at 9.5 hours, though I wasn&rsquo;t expecting that to be anything close to real. At 380 Euros it wasn&rsquo;t dirt cheap, but then again, its not that expensive&hellip; And if it was powerful enough, I wouldn&rsquo;t have to travel with a full-sized laptop either.

    I have had this thing now for about 4 weeks and I am constantly amazed at how fantastic it is. It has blown away all expectations. Every few days I am finding new tasks that I can do with it, further reducing the number of reasons I have to carry a full-sized laptop (I will forever need one for work though, since I typically run 3-4 virtual machines for classes).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    So let me run through some of the reasons I love this thing:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Great Battery Life</strong>:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Its advertised as having 9.5 hour battery life. I didn&rsquo;t believe that they would be anything close to accurate. To make things worse, I wiped the HD and installed Windows 7 for which there are no official drivers. But after everything is installed and running, <strong>I can easily get 8.5 hours and sometimes a little bit more</strong>. It should be great to use in Jiri, Nepal where they are lucky to get 8-10 hours of electric power per day. In fact, check this out. The box has been running for a bit over 2 hours now and here is the current estimate of power available.

  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Photo Tasks</strong>:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    One of the main tasks I hope to achieve with this was the ability to manage photos while I was traveling for fun. Its not a high-powered photo editing workstation, but<strong> its fast enough to run Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 2</strong>. Plus with a 160GB harddrive, it has <strong>plenty of room to offload photos from the CF cards from my digital cameras</strong>.

    <strong>Dev Tasks</strong>:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Occasionally I have an idea that needs to be put down in code. For this Visual Studio 2008 is wonderful to have. <strong>The 1000HE runs VS and compiles just fine</strong>. Its not going to win speed awards, but its good enough while I am supposed to be relaxing.

  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Troubleshooting Tasks</strong>:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Sometimes I find it interesting to break open a Packet Capture tool. At first it didn&rsquo;t seem to work, but with the latest beta versions of WinPCap, <a href="http://www.wireshark.org" target="_blank"><strong>Wireshark</strong></a><strong> and other related tools do a fantastic job</strong>.

  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Other Tasks</strong>:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Since I loaded up Windows 7, I get all the benefits of that new OS. <strong>I love the new scripting environment available with the Powershell ISE</strong>. Makes coming up with new utility scripts much easier than before.
  </p>
  
  <p>

The little camera built in to the bezel should be cool if I ever use Skype.&nbsp; VLC does a fantastic job of playing almost every video I give it.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>What the device cannot do</strong>:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Although I really love this box, there are a few things I hate. The keyboard is a bit small, but its workable and I am getting used to it. <strong>The main gripe I have is the fact that it only has a trackpad. Apparently it supports Multitouch, but its still a trackpad. I so wish it had a much more functional and easier to use pointing stick instead. It is really annoying having to use this and productivity drops immensely due to not having the stick</strong>. Whenever I fist start using a Thinkpad, the first thing I do is disable that touchpad at the bottom. I wish manufacturers would get rid of the useless wastes of space that they are.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I wish it had a CF slot in addition to the SD slot. My Canon IXUS 870 IS uses a SD card, but my D700 and D70 use CF. Sure I can carry a card reader, but having it built in would be fantastic.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Video performance is great, but the device crawls when I feed it a video from my Mino UltraHD. I can convert it to something more useful and then play, but I get no love with the raw file.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Summary</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Despite those few weaknesses, <strong>I really do love this laptop</strong>. It has completely blown away all my expectations and I will be happy to drop off my Thinkpad with friends in Dubai when I go off from there to Kathmandu in a couple weeks. I can fully recommend the Asus eee PC 1000 HE.
