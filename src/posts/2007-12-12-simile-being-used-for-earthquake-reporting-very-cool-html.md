    While I was living on the US West Coast, I would often feel a bit of a tremor&#8230;or at least I thought I did. I would then always visit one of the many sites out there that reports on that data. But they weren&#8217;t exactly interactive. Then when looking around for other uses of Simile <a href="http://www.oe-files.de/gmaps/usgseq.html" target="_blank">I stumbled on this</a>. At the top of the page is a simile timeline of recent earthquakes. But then its linked to the google map below showing where it was. You can also click on the map to see when it was and what other earthquakes happened around that time. Its a pretty interesting use of the tools.

    And how else would I have found out there was an earthquake last night in Germany&#8230;.hmmm&#8230;.
