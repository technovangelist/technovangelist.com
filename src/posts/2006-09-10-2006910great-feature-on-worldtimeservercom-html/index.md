    OK, after finding out about that great feature of Google, I looked around a bit at the service I was replacing. Wow, there is a great page on there called <a href="http://worldtimeserver.com/meeting-planner.aspx">Meeting Planner</a>. Enter in your location, and up to 5 other locations and after a while it comes up with a nice pretty chart that shows the times in each location throughout the day, highlighting the mid day hours, and also making it clear when it is really too late to call.

    This is really awesome. I am going to print this out on a color printer and put it up on my wall. Its an incredible reference and a very cool idea.
