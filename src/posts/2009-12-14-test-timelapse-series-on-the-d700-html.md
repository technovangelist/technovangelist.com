    Recently I have seen a few amazing timelapse videos on the net. I especially enjoyed the videos at <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/delrious">http://www.vimeo.com/delrious</a>. Check this one out:

    So I was eager to see if I could produce something similar. Well, the result shown below may not be amazing, but I see lots of potential. It was all shot from my hotel room in Tokyo last night with a Nikon D700 using the built in intervalometer. I will try a sunset tonight from the office building I am working at today at Roppongi Hills. I am up on the 30th floor, so it should be a better view.
