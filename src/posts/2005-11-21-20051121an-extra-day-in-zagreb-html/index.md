It seems the Customs office is having a difficult time with my laptops and has delayed their entry. They were supposed to be delivered on Friday, but they didn&rsquo;t even arrive into the country until early this morning&hellip;.and customs doesn&rsquo;t want to release. So class is delayed till tomorrow. The plus side of this is that I get an extra day in Zagreb. There are definitely worse places in the world to get stuck.
