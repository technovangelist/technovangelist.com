Over the years I have been a user of a number of RSS reader applications. NewsGator was a favorite for a while, then FeedDemon, RSSBandit, and a whole bunch of others. Right now I am using&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/omea/">Omea Pro</a>&nbsp;2.1.1. But I was getting ready to switch again. The problem I was having with Omea was that it took SOOOO FREAKING LONG to start. Upwards of 3&ndash;5 minutes to start an application. Not every time, just some of the time. Its ridiculous. Then I looked at the Plugins in the Options menu. In order to show you that Omea does a lot of things, they enable everything. There are plugins for Miranda (I don&rsquo;t know what Miranda is), ICQ, Outlook, and more. So I turned off a bunch that I either don&rsquo;t understand or simply don&rsquo;t want (Contacts, ICQ, Miranda, Outlook, Tasks). Wow, Omea now starts in less than&nbsp;5 seconds every time. Excellent.
