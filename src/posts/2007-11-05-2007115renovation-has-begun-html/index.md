    Well, the builder came by yesterday to pick up the keys and his team started work today. I had a class but as soon as it was over, I rushed home to see what they had done. The floors are up: the carpet is out on the deck and the wood laminates are stacked against each wall. I guess they remove it all later. They also started dismantling the kitchen. As always, see the <a href="/photos/renovation/default.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Renovation Gallery</a> for the pics, but Day 1 begins <a href="/photos/renovation/picture2265.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">here</a>.
