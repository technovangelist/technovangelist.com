For the most part I gave up on Acrobat&#8217;s own PDF viewer a while back. <a href="http://www.foxitsoftware.com/">Foxit Software</a> makes a far faster tool for viewing PDFs. Unfortunately I had to keep Acrobat for the times I wanted to print a large document. In that case, Acrobat was several orders of magnitude faster than Foxit (a few minutes to print a 200 page document vs over an hour). Well, Foxit has come up with v2 of their reader. One of the listed improvements is faster printing times. I look forward to trying this out when I go back into the office on Monday. Hopefully then I can completely remove Acrobat from my system.
