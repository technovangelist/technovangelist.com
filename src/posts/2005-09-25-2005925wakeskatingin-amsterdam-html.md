When I think of wakeboarding I think of big lakes, big motorboats, and a rope. Seen it all over the place in the US, from where I grew up on Key Biscayne, to Seattle, to SF, and more. Amsterdam could probably do it on the canals, if it weren&rsquo;t for the wake. But these guys did it in the small pond/fountain in front of the Rijksmuseum in the middle of the city. The pond is 75 meters long and 30 centimeters deep&hellip;.not enough for the big boat. So that is where the big-ass winch comes in. This thing yanks the boarder across the surface of the pond at a pretty good clip. Amazing to <a href="http://www.webvent.nl/downloads/WakeSkate.wmv" class="broken_link">watch</a>&hellip;.
