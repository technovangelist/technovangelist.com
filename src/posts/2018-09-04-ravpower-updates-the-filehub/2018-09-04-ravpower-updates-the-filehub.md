A  few months ago, I made a video about the RAVPower FileHub Plus (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ls5R6j1gms). Its definitely my most successful video on my personal channel. Last night I pushed an update to the video about a new version of the FileHub. The new model is the FileHub WD007. I think this is a huge upgrade to the previous version of the product and was excited to pick it up. As long as you are good with using a device with a confusing UI, annoying UX, and pitiful support, you may also love this device. 

Check out the video and then if interested you can find the updated FileHub here.
