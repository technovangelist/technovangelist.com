title: Great fontsâ€¦
---
This morning I was reading the latest issue of the <a href="http://www.techsupportalert.com/">Tech Support Alert Newsletter</a> and found a link to <a href="http://www.alvit.de/blog/article/20-best-license-free-official-fonts">Vitaly Friedman&rsquo;s list of 25 free fonts</a>. These are great. Not sure I am going to write a manual or other document with them yet, but I may find a use for them soon. Another set of fonts I use often is in Visual Studio and other similar tools. The fonts come from <a href="http://proggyfonts.com/">proggyfonts.com</a> and are wonderful monospaced fonts that are crisp, clear, and small while staying very readable. Click on the download button for images of the fonts and download links for several types of font files.
