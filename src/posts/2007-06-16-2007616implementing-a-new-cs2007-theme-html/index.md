A few months ago, the amazing folks at <a href="http://telligent.com/">Telligent</a> updated their Community Server product to <a href="http://communityserver.org/">Community Server 2007</a>. I updated this site to CS2007 a few weeks back and around that time I decided I should get rid of the standard paperclip theme and write my own. And of course, because I enjoy inflicting excess pain onto myself, I started from scratch. There is a lot that can be done with CS2007 and I know that even more now that I am going through this exercise. I have started using the new theme live on this site, but I am far from finished. Many of the features are working, but not looking great.

Well, the upside is that I have one more topic now to blog about. The <a href="http://docs.communityserver.org/wiki/page.aspx/26/themes/" class="broken_link">documentation for creating themes</a> (most of it seems to be written by <a href="http://getben.com/tags/Chameleon/default.aspx" class="broken_link">Ben Tiedt</a>)
