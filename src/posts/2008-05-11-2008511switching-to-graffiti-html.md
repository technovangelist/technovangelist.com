  <p>
    I have this love/hate relationship with this blog. I love having posted to it, but I hate posting to it. Having a poorly performing and poorly laid out site only added to the hate side of that relationship. So I switched the site just now from Community Server to Graffiti. Been playing around with Graffiti themes today and hope to have something interesting here soon.
