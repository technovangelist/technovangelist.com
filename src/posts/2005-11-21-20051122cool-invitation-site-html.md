OK, now this is cool. <a href="http://meetwithapproval.com/">Meetwithapproval.com</a> is a site like evite and many others that allow you to send invites for a meeting, party, or other event to a bunch of people. But often an exact time doesn&rsquo;t work out for everyone at first. Gradually you come up with a good time that works for all&hellip;but changing those details is problematic on evite, plus there is that whole registration thing. Here is a cooler way to go: no registration, and everyone invited can (if allowed by the organizer) suggest new times/days to meet. They can also (again, if allowed by the organizer) invite others.The combination of no registration, free, and easily suggesting new times makes this a killer web site!!!
