  <p>
    While doing a <a href="http://www.kessels.com/JkDefrag/">defrag</a> on a drive this morning, I was reading <a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=2124">Chris Sell&#8217;s blog</a> between testing out a little C# <a href="http://30boxes.com/api/#events.GetDisplayList">30Boxes</a> tool (its only 530 AM) and I saw his <a href="http://www.nerdtests.com">NerdTests.com</a> results. I thought I would try it out. Whoda thunk, I am a Highly Dorky Nerd King. It appears that I am much more well rounded than Chris&#8230;I am not sure whether that is a good thing or not.
