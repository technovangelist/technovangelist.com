    Many people are lucky when they visit their local art museum once every few years. I was just thinking back on some of the museums I have seen just in the last couple of months. Its actually quite an amazing list. Yesterday I saw the massive sea-going vessels at the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.khm.uio.no/english/viking_ship_museum/" class="broken_link">Viking Ship Museum</a>&nbsp;and traditional Norwegian homes at the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.norskfolke.museum.no/">Norwegian Folk Museum</a>, both in Oslo, Norway. Last week I saw aboriginal art at the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/home_zen">Art Gallery of New South Wales</a>&nbsp;near the Sydney Opera House and the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.zoo.nsw.gov.au/">Taronga Zoo</a>&nbsp;overlooking Sydney Harbour. A couple of weeks before that it was the massive stained glass roof at the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/">National Gallery of Victoria</a>&nbsp;in Melbourne. A week before that it was the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nhb.gov.sg/ACM" class="broken_link">Asian Civilization Museum</a>&nbsp;in Singapore, not only a wonderful place to learn of the cultures of the area, but also a lifesaving refuge from the heat outside. In the weeks before that it was the incredible&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dubaitourism.ae/HistoricalSites/default.asp">Dubai Museum</a>&nbsp;at Al Fahidi Fort in Dubai, and the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mdc.hr/mgz/eng/fs-okvir-eng.html" class="broken_link">Zagreb City Museum</a>&nbsp;in the upper town of Zagreb. This is a fantastic list and one I hope to grow in the near future. In fact,&nbsp;I am looking forward to visiting the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.moe.go.th/webfad/natmus.htm">National Museum</a>&nbsp;in Bangkok Thailand next weekend. Maybe since I am home I should visit the<a href="http://rijksmuseum.nl/index.jsp">Rijksmuseum</a>&nbsp;here in Amsterdam this weekend. Or maybe a place I haven&rsquo;t seen like the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.scheepvaartmuseum.nl/">Netherlands Shipbuilding Museum</a>, and compare what I see the Viking ships from yesterday.
