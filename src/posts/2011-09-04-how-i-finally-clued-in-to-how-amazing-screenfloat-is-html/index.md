  <p>
    This morning I was trying to read some docs for a cool little command line utility called XMLStarlet. Unfortunately the docs were written so that the sample commands referred to sample content defined a few pages earlier in the document. That meant that I needed a lot of scrolling back and forth to fully understand what I was reading. Thankfully just a few weeks ago I had bought a great little app called <a href="http://eternalstorms.at/ScreenFloat/ScreenFloat/ScreenFloat_-_make_your_shots_fly%21.html">ScreenFloat from Eternal Storms</a>. I was able to take a quick shot of the sample xml docs, then refer to it very easily while reading the example commands further down the page. Its kinda hard to describe, so I recorded a quick little demo for you to watch instead.
