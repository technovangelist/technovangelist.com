title: That photo at the top of the page
---
A few people have asked me about the photo at the top of this page. What does it have to do with technology? Well, nothing. I took it outside my sister&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.sfbr.org/pages/genetics_projects.php?p=36" class="broken_link">clinic</a> in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=86%C2%B0+14'+0%22+E,+27%C2%B0+38'+0%22+N&spn=3.277407,5.703827&t=h&hl=en">Jiri, Nepal</a>. Its just a photo I like with good space to the left for the word &lsquo;technovangelist&rsquo;.
