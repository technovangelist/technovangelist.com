    This is my first post via a blackberry. After resisting for a while I finally succumbed to ITs wishes and switched to bb. Pretty cool. Too bad its so big to accomplish almost everything my ms smartphone could do. Some will say but its got the full keyboard. It aint that full. Anyway, sitting in my hotel in Oslo about to get my workflow manuals printed and thought I would try this out.
