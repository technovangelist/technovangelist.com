I use a crazy keyboard layout and I wanted a way to automatically switch the layout depending on the keyboard attached. Hooray for Hammerspoon. Hammerspoon is a MacOS automation solution  using Lua to solve interesting problems in an easy way. In this video I show you how I use Hammerspoon to configure my keyboard layout quickly and easily.

I need to update the video to show that you don't actually need to use KeyboardSwitcher. hs.keycodes.setLayout() does the same thing. I will post an update of this in the next few weeks. thanks to Chris Jones (http://www.youtube.com/user/cmsj) for the pointer.
