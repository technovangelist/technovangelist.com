title: Upcoming travelâ€¦

The travel schedule is already beginning, though the first trip is only partially work related. Tomorrow I head to London for the day. And its only to get a document stamped. Crazy, I know. My stuff is getting shipped from San Francisco to Amsterdam, but in order to get it here I need to prove that I live in Amsterdam. In order to do that I need to register with the local municipality. In order to do that I need to have a birth certificate with an apostille on it.
