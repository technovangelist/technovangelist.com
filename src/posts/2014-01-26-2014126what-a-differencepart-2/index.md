title: What a Differenceâ€¦Part 2
---
Four months ago, I wrote [a blog post describing the year up to September 2013][1]{.broken_link}. It was a whirlwind year for me. But the last 4 months since that date have been pretty amazing too.

The big change happened in November; Thanksgiving Day to be exact. Toni and I took the train down to New York City, used my points to stay at a great hotel near Grand Central, and wandered the city for 4 days. 

On the first day, we trekked across town and found the Highline, something we had both wanted to see for years. While wandering along the beautiful above-ground park, we held each other tight for warmth on the freezing cold day. At one point we took a break and sat on some bleacher seats built into the path. 

After a short rest, it was there that I took my next step. I asked the love of my life if she would marry me. She said yes. 

Since then we have been planning our wedding and continuing to love every day we have together. Every day we learn more about each other and become happier and happier about our decision to spend the rest of our lives together. 

Our &#8220;Save the Dates&#8221; went out a few days ago and I look forward to seeing some of you there as we both say **I Do**.
