In my most recent Captaris Workflow class in Bendigo one of the students asked about solving a problem with our implementation of our Sharepoint Web Part. The issue was that we have one web part that does everything. This is great if you want it to do everything, but sometimes you just want a task list like the one that shows up in our web access product. Well, its actually really easy to create one in less than 10 minutes. The one shown in the picture shows my task list, the processes they come from, and the due date. Since my locale is US, I have US dates. If I had a different locale, they would be shown correctly for the locale.
