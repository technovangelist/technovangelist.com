This is a question for those of you subscribing to the rss feed. As you may have seen I recently switched over to using FeedBurner. Is this an improvement? Is there anything you have seen in other FeedBurner feeds that isn&#8217;t in this one but should be? I look forward to hearing any of your comments.
