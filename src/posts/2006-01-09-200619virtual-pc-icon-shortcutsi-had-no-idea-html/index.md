I have spent quite a lot of time using the tool both at Captaris and during my time at Microsoft. But in all that time, I never noticed that you could right-click on the little icons on the bottom left of the window. Right-click on the first icon, and you get HD options. On the CD you get CD options, the floppy gets floppy options, etc. Yeah, all of this is also accessible from the Options menu, but this is one click. Very cool&hellip;
