I have arrived. I have the keys and I am sitting in my own apartment. Its wonderful, but I am so exhausted now. I have been up for way too long after getting minimal sleep the last few days as movers came and went, last minute items were sold, then packed and got to the airport. Being able to stretch out on the plane was nice, but even bizclass is kinda uncomfortable for 8 hours. Right now I am sitting in my living room looking out my window onto the Prinsengracht and trying so hard to keep my eyes open. I want to go to sleep but I have to move my car and meet my landlord at 3&#133;. then&#133;sleep at last&#133;hopefully the apartment will still be real when I wake&#133;
