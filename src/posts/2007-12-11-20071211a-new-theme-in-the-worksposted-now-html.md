    So I am updating the theme on this site. Its not done, but there are already a lot of changes I am pretty excited about. Its still not perfect, but <a href="/blogs/technovangelist/archive/2007/11/30/taking-on-a-new-challenge-after-next-week" target="_blank" class="broken_link">I have a bit of time on my hands right now</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Whats working and is pretty cool:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Current Twitter Status &#8211; ok that was there before
    </li>
    <li>
      Upcoming Travel from <a href="http://30boxes.com/" target="_blank">30Boxes</a> &#8211; Its grabbing my future travel schedule from 30B. When a date goes past, it will no longer show up on the page&#8230;automatically
    </li>
    <li>
      Recent Del.icio.us Tags &#8211; Its grabbing the last 5 or 6 days worth of links I have tagged.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://www.captaris.com/developerprogram/" target="_blank">Captaris Developer Program</a> Posts &#8211; I also occasionally post to the Captaris Developer Program. This is a list of all of <a href="http://www.captaris.com/DeveloperProgram/blogs/trainermatt_blog/default.aspx" target="_blank">those posts</a>. As with the above items, this is dynamic.
    </li>
    <li>
      Blog Flare &#8211; Took a while to figure this out. Each post can be added to Digg, Facebook, Technorati&#8230;.ok, they won&#8217;t, but they could.
    </li>
    <li>
      Full vs Excerpts &#8211; The most recent 3 posts are the full post. Then there are a bunch more that are just excerpts.
    </li>
    <li>
      Cool icons from <a href="http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/" target="_blank">FamFamFam: Silk</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="/blogs/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Simile Timeline</a> &#8211; This is one of the coolest new features. Rather than a traditional calendar of previous items, I am now showing an interactive timeline of all blog posts here.
    </li>
  </ul>
