So today I saw a blog posting regarding some new attempt to come up with a &#8220;official&#8221;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.new7wonders.com/index.php">7 Wonders of the World</a>&nbsp;list. Apparently voting has been going on for a few years and was according&nbsp;to some a &#8220;worldwide&#8221; effort. What? You never heard of this effort? Neither had I. I guess they should rename it to the 7Wonders according to a few online users in a few select countries. That&#8217;s not to say I don&#8217;t agree with most of the choices. The Great Wall, Machu Picchu, Petra, and the Taj Mahal are certainly in that category. But the Christ Redeemer in Brazil? Is that a joke? Sure, its a neat tourist attraction, but Wonder of&nbsp; the World? More amazing than say Angkor Wat? Hardly.
