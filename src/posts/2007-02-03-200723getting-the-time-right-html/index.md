Yeah, sure I am a frequent world traveler, but I am a complete moron when it comes to figuring out what time it is where ever I am about to go. Tomorrow I go to London and thats easy because its one hour behind Amsterdam. But in a few weeks I go to Singapore, then Melbourne, then Sydney, then Dubai in a single trip. While I can look up the timezones in the Windows Time dialog, its too easy to change my time zone right then. Right now to help me along I use three tools, and none are really easy to configure. The first is on my desktop. I use Samurize and have a config that shows me time in Seattle, Miami, Amsterdam, Singapore, and Sydney, along with current CPU utilization, ip addresses, and disk space.<span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><span><img src="/static/500c9c42c4aa27cb90863e5e/50e9971de4b01058545b4678/50e99720e4b01058545b48fa/1257631075703/mysamurize14.png/1000w" alt="" /></span></span>

I split it across four pieces so it would fit on one screen. Another tool I use is a simple web page that shows the same time zones that I can access on my blackberry. The third tool is my&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Seiko-Sportura-Analog-Digital-SNJ011P1/dp/B000LEWLLG/sr=1-49/qid=1170505561/ref=sr_1_49/105-6297239-7953266?ie=UTF8&s=jewelry">Seiko Sportura</a>world time watch which shows me two time zones at a time. These do an adequate job of showing time zones so I don&#8217;t call someone at 4am though they take a bit of time to use. The Samurize and web page configs are tough to edit. My parents sold&nbsp;my childhood home off the coast of Miami and have moved full time to Bainbridge Island&nbsp;near Seattle, but both still show Miami. And I can&#8217;t change the names of time zones on the watch. For local time I am stuck with it saying Paris.

But I just found out about a new utility from Microsoft to ease my pain a bit.

Any one of them can easily become your current time zone. And configuring them is braindead easy and a right click away. I&#8217;ll keep this running for a while to see if it fits for me&#8230;..
