    I just finished my class in Dubai and a student asked about SMTP integration. My throat was shot and I was barely able to think straight, so I didn&#8217;t have an answer for him. But after I had a chance to recover, I tried it out and came up with this little screencast on the problem. Its very easy as you can see here. By the way, this video is now hosted on YouTube, Google Video, and Revver. Revver is by far the best of these because I can actually see what I am doing.

    UPDATE October 22, 2011 &#8211; wow, this is still a popular post, but Revver seems to have disappeared a while back. I posted this at the same time on YouTube so go here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nw5nYRJIgA&list=UUHaF9kM2wn8C3CLRwLkC2GQ&feature=plcp">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nw5nYRJIgA&list=UUHaF9kM2wn8C3CLRwLkC2GQ&feature=plcp</a>

    I&#8217;ll update this at some point on the main site for these things: <a href="http://youtube.com/opentextfddg" class="broken_link">http://youtube.com/opentextfddg</a>
