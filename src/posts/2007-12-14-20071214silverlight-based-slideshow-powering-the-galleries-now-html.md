    Earlier today I saw <a href="http://www.nikhilk.net/Silverlight-Slideshow.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Nikhil Kothari</a> had implemented a cool slide show on his site. It was exactly what I was looking for. Unfortunately I spent the last 8 hours trying to figure out how to implement it. Some of that time was wasted on a stupid error&#8230;grrr&#8230;.a few more hours on getting it to work on CS. Anyway, check out the galleries and let me know what you think. I will write up a post on how I implemented it in the next couple of days. I also have to solve the wierd 4001 error thats coming up&#8230;oh and post some photos&#8230;
