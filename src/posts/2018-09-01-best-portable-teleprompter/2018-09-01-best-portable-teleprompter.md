Teleprompters are great tools to help you make your videos far more professional. I have been searching for the perfect **portable** teleprompter. My PadPrompter from OneTakeOnly is bulky, so I wanted something smaller that would pack well in my backpack. This is mostly because where ever I am, the teleprompter is probably somewhere else. When I found the LittlePrompter, I thought it could be perfect. Well, its not perfect, but for most people, its pretty damned good. If you don't want to keep it in your backpack where ever you go, it could be perfect for you. Check out the video here, then if interested you can find the link to purchase below.
