title: Single Clicking To Open A File In PHPStorm
---
I have been using PHPStorm for a few weeks and really enjoy it. I came here after using SublimeText 2&3 for the last few years, plus vim when I need to do something quick. But one of the big annoyances for me has been the need to double-click to open a file. Yeah, it&#8217;s kind of a silly thing to complain about, but I was very excited today to find the solution.

The fix is a strangely labelled option in the Project Files settings dropdown. Now I don&#8217;t mean in the main settings area, but rather from the gear icon in the Project View. In that dropdown you will find two magic options: Autoscroll To Source and Autoscroll From Source. 

Turn both of these on and now a single click on a file opens it on the editor and selecting any open file highlights it in the project file list. Sweet!!!
