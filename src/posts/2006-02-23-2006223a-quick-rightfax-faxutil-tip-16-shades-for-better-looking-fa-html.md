Whenever I am talking about Rightfax to a company that is already using the product, the one feature they are always surprised to hear about is the ability to have a better view of a fax. With the default install of FaxUtil, which is the client, faxes look fairly splotchy and ugly. Take this screenshot from a fax I just sent.<span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><span><img src="/static/500c9c42c4aa27cb90863e5e/50e9971de4b01058545b4678/50e9971fe4b01058545b48b7/1257622970059/ScreenShot046.jpg/1000w" alt="" /></span></span>&nbsp;

Now that is pretty damned ugly. The problem is that its black and white, not grayscale. The fix is to go to Tools | Gray Scale and choose 16 Shades. But this only fixes it for this viewing session. To set this up for EVERY fax you view, go to Tools | Options and choose 16 Shades from the drop down at the bottom. Now all your faxes will look like this when you view them in FaxUtil.<span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><span><img src="/static/500c9c42c4aa27cb90863e5e/50e9971de4b01058545b4678/50e9971fe4b01058545b48b8/1257622971137/ScreenShot047.jpg/1000w" alt="" /></span></span>&nbsp;Of course, the actual fax looks the same when the person on the other end receives it.
