About a year ago, I spoke at AWS re:Invent about [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and [Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/). Lambda is AWS' serverless offering and Step Functions is a way to orchestrate multiple Lambdas. The demo I showed was me live blogging my session as I delivered my session. It was pretty cool to watch. But a big part of my workflow was push to [AWS CodeCommit](//aws.amazon.com/codecommit/), which is their hosted Git service and having that trigger a [GatsbyJS](//gatsbyjs.org) build. 

It took a bit of effort to get everything to work just right.
