I just found one of the cooler login controls I have ever seen. Go check out <a href="http://daptivate.com/default.aspx" class="broken_link">Kyle Beyer&#8217;s</a> website and click on the sign-in button at the top left. Very slick. He even covers it in detail in a blog post at <a title="http://daptivate.com/archive/2007/02/26/ajax-login-compatibility-with-asp-net-authentication.aspx" href="http://daptivate.com/archive/2007/02/26/ajax-login-compatibility-with-asp-net-authentication.aspx" class="broken_link">http://daptivate.com/archive/2007/02/26/ajax-login-compatibility-with-asp-net-authentication.aspx</a>. I definitely have to try that. Of course, I just blew an entire weekend working on this site and the idea of spending more time on it makes me feel a bit guilty.
