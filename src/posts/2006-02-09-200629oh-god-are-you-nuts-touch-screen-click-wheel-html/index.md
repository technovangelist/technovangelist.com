title: Oh god, are you nuts?!?! Touch screen click wheel?!?!
---
On ThinkSecret there is an article about a <a href="http://www.thinksecret.com/news/0602videoipod.html" class="broken_link">possible next gen iPod with a touch screen click wheel</a>. Does anyone think this is a good idea??? Lets take a device that scratches to all hell as soon as you breathe on it, and take the one surface area that doesn&rsquo;t scratch and turn it into the same surface as the rest. This device requires a sheath in order to keep it in order, but of course that can&rsquo;t cover the click wheel otherwise nothing will work. I wish Apple could focus some of its efforts on developing a surface that doesn&rsquo;t shred on contact, thus pissing off customers as soon as they buy it&hellip;.or how about upgrading iTunes to have a consistent UI&hellip;.or&hellip;ugh&hellip;people have been asking for this since day one&hellip;.I give up&hellip;.
