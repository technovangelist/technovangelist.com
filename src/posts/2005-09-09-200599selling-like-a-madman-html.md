Whew, today was a good day. Sold my 27&rdquo; TV, DVD player, receiver, coffee table, bedside drawers, and side table. I was starting to get worried this morning about how I would get rid of it all in time. I feel better now. My 2 Dell Latitudes are close to selling on EBay as is the NAD L40. The D.Vine case is gone, along with the Viewsonic monitor, and a pair of sony noise canceling headphones. There will still be lots to do when I get back from Amsterdam and Seattle in a week and a half, but its more doable now.
