This afternoon as I was driving north from Utrecht to Amsterdam, it looked like Amsterdam was burning. There was this HUGE plume of dark smoke coming from the city. When I got to the city I lost sight of the source, though I was very relieved to see that it wasn&rsquo;t in the center of the city where I live. I have no idea what happened.
