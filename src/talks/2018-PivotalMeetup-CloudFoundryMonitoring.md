If you donâ€™t measure a system, there is no way to improve. This is true regardless of the platform. But how do you measure the health of your Cloud Foundry environment as well as the applications you have running on it? In this talk, Matt Williams from Datadog talks about what a good metric looks like and the different perspectives required to get 100% observability. We will cover the basics of observability and then get into a live demo monitoring a Cloud Foundry environment and its applications. You will come away with a simple framework you can use to think about metrics, and how to apply that framework to Cloud Foundry.
