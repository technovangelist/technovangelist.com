Serverless and AWS Lambda specifically allows developers to build super scalable application components with minimal effort. AWS Kinesis and SQS can be used to create a universal event stream to orchestrate Lambdas into much more complex applications. Now, with AWS Step Functions we can build large distributed applications with Lambdas using visual workflows. In this session you will see how Step Functions are different from Amazon Simple Workflow, how to get started with Step Functions, and how to use them to take your Lambda-based applications to the next level. We will start with a few granular functions and stitch them up using Step Functions. As we build out the application, weâ€™ll add monitoring so that we can ensure that changes we make actually improve things rather than make them worse. You will leave the session with actionable learnings about how to use AWS Step Functions in your environment right away.
