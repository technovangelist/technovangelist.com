Transform yourself from a monitoring novice to a Datadog expert with hands-on training led by the engineers who build, maintain, and support Datadog. Weâ€™ll share best practices for building insightful dashboards and visualizations and tips for effective alerting and dive into container monitoring with Autodiscovery. Attendees will leave with hands-on experience using these techniques that they can bring home to their own environments for more effective monitoring.
