### Talk Description
OK, you have built your first Lambda function. It may even be useful (and not just a thumbnail generator). But an application is more than a single function; you need a lot of them. How do you get your functions working together? In this introduction Iâ€™ll get you started with Step Functions and show you how easy it is to use them to orchestrate AWS Lambda.

### Discussion Topics
After the presentation was over we talked about a number of topics for a good 45-60 minutes. Some of the topics included:

* Using [NodeRed](https://nodered.org/) as an alternative
* Using [Serverless' Event Gateway](https://serverless.com/event-gateway/) to connect resources from different clouds
* My link shortener. [Based on this article](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-build-a-serverless-url-shortener-using-aws-lambda-and-s3-4fbdf70cbf5c).
* The buildings at UnderArmour HQ are named after Proctor and Gambel products: Tide, Ivory, etc. [Read more about the facility and the company here](https://www.baltimoremagazine.com/2013/8/1/a-look-inside-under-armour).
