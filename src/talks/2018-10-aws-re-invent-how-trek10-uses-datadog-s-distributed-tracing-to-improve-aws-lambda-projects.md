Tracing is always a challenge, no matter what your architecture is. Creating an application with serverless functions, such as with AWS Lambda, provides agility and scalability to your application, but it also creates an added challenge for code tracing. In this session, we review Datadog's distributed tracing capabilities and how Trek10 uses those capabilities to improve its customersâ€™ applications. Learn how to use AWS X-Ray in a serverless environment. Also, learn strategies for working with traces and logs that explain application errors. Finally, learn how Trek10 uses AWS X-Ray with Datadog to measure and improve its applications' performance. This session is brought to you by AWS partner, Datadog.
